# Project setup

Make sure you have node installed and the node version should >= 12.0

Intall `yarn` for package management

`brew install yarn`

Use the following Command to install all the packages

`yarn`

install angular

`yarn install -g @angular/cli`

# Development tips

I tend to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

Install packages with `yarn add dependency-name` or
`yarn add -D dependency-name` if it's only used for development.

# Developing/Testing Project

## On Browser

`yarn start`

open your browser and access

`http://localhost:4200/`
